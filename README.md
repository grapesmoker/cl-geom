A 2D and 3D geometry library in Common Lisp

For some reason, Lisp seems to lack a flexible geometry package. The goal is to implement a fully generic system of 2D and 3D geometry, including matrices, vectors, and quaternions. The package should be straightforward to use and `nice' in that it wraps operations in a sensible error-checking process.

This is a work in progress and not intended for widespread use just yet.
